## Objective

This project is a study repo created to:

1. Explore the wonderful Pygame's graphics library
2. Code and test some gaming concepts (collisions, animations, cameras, tilesets, etc.)
3. Create utility functions/ideas that can be used in other Pygame projects

`PS`: This project is a WIP (and may forever remain as one).

## Used tools

This project, so far, uses the following tools (among many others):

- `Python 3.9` as the project's programming language
- `Pygame` as the main graphics library
- `Aseprite` for sprites/pixel-art drawings
- `Tiled` for tilesets and tiled maps editing
- `Pytest` as the main testing framework/test runner

## Graphics

The pixel art contained in this repo were created by me with the help of the [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) software.

## Running the game

Run pipenv 'start' script which will run the `src` library as Python module:

```sh
pipenv run start
```

## Running tests

Just invoke pipenv 'test' script, which will start a pytest session:

```sh
pipenv run test
```
